Okay, the user wants to convert a Node.js project to TypeScript. Let me think about the steps involved here. First, I remember that TypeScript adds static types to JavaScript, so the main steps would involve setting up the TypeScript compiler, updating the code with types, and adjusting the project configuration.

Hmm, the first thing they'll need is to install TypeScript and the necessary type definitions. So, they should run npm install typescript @types/node --save-dev. That installs the TypeScript compiler and the Node.js type definitions. Oh, right, they might also need to initialize a tsconfig.json file. Using npx tsc --init would create that configuration file. They might need to adjust the settings in there, like target, module, outDir, rootDir, and strict.

Next, the file structure. Usually, people keep TypeScript files in a src directory and output the compiled JavaScript to a dist or build folder. So updating the tsconfig.json to set "outDir" to "./dist" and "rootDir" to "./src" makes sense. That way, when they compile, the JS files go into dist.

Then, the package.json needs some changes. They should change the main entry point to the compiled JS file, like "./dist/index.js". Also, adding scripts for building and starting the app. The build script would run tsc to compile, and start might be "node dist/index.js". Maybe a dev script using ts-node-dev to watch and reload changes during development.

Now, converting the actual .js files to .ts. Each file needs to have its exports and functions typed. For example, changing require to import statements. Adding interfaces for objects, specifying types for function parameters and return values. Any variables without explicit types might need them, using any as a last resort but ideally more specific types.

Error handling might need adjustments. TypeScript is strict about types, so they might have to handle cases where variables could be undefined or of different types. Using union types or type guards could help there.

Dependencies like Express would need their types too. So installing @types/express --save-dev is necessary. That way, TypeScript knows about the Express types.

Testing the setup is important. After making these changes, running npm run build should compile the TS files into JS in the dist directory. Then npm start to run the app. If there are type errors, they'll need to go back and fix those, maybe adding more specific types or adjusting the code to satisfy the compiler.

Oh, and if they're using modules, they might need to change moduleResolution in tsconfig.json to node or something else appropriate. Also, enabling strict mode is recommended for better type checking, but that might require more code changes to fix resulting errors.

I should also mention common issues. Like, if they use CommonJS modules, they might need to use import/export syntax or adjust the module setting in tsconfig. Any third-party libraries without types would require installing @types packages or declaring modules manually.

So, summarizing the steps: install dependencies, set up config, adjust project structure, convert files to TS with proper types, update package.json scripts, handle type errors, and test. Providing an example conversion would help, showing how a JS file becomes a TS file with interfaces and type annotations.
